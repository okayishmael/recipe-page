### Useful resources

- [Minfy CSS online ](https://www.toptal.com/developers/cssminifier) - I asked co-pilot to evaluate my code and it suggested minifying it. This is a site that you can paste you css in and it minify it for you. 

- [vs code on git  and github](https://youtu.be/i_23KUAEtUM) - This helped me successfully get my github and tought how to branch edit and merge back to main repository 
- [Set GH pages for you a live site on github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to set up gh pages on github.
